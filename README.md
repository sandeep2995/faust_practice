Faust -- Python Stream Processing Library

This library adapts ideas from Java-based Kafka Frames to Python for stream processing.

Note:  [Faust](https://faust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has not beeen updated for more than 2 years now.
But, there is a fork called [faust-streaming](https://github.com/faust-streaming/faust) which is updated at least 4 months ago.

However, I would start practicing with the Faust native library because of its popularity.
